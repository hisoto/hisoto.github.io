Hey! My name is Héctor. I'm an economist from El Colegio de México, currently working as a [Labor Market Analysis Coordinator](https://mx.linkedin.com/in/h%C3%A9ctor-iv%C3%A1n-soto-parra-0386ba337) at the [National Minimum Wage Commission](https://www.gob.mx/conasami) of Mexico.

My daily activities involve the analysis of labor market trends, the evaluation of public policies, and the use of quantitative methods to inform the minimum wage setting process.
