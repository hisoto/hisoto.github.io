Hey! I'm Héctor, an economist from [El Colegio de México](https://www.colmex.mx/), currently working as a [Labor Market Analysis Coordinator](https://mx.linkedin.com/in/h%C3%A9ctor-iv%C3%A1n-soto-parra-0386ba337) at the [National Minimum Wage Commission](https://www.gob.mx/conasami) of Mexico. I'm very passionate about economics in general, particularly in labor and industrial economics with a focus on policy, as well as inferential statistics. I'm a huge nerd!!

I'm from Cuernavaca, a small city in the center of Mexico, but I'm currently living in Mexico City.

## My work and research

My daily activities involve the analysis of labor market trends, the evaluation of public policies, and the use of quantitative methods to inform the minimum wage setting process. Particularly, I study [price dynamics](https://github.com/hisoto/comportamiento_precios), salary negotiations and poverty lines.

My main project right now is the [*Canasta digna*](https://github.com/hisoto/Living-wage-mexico), a national and subnational living wage estimation for Mexico that is going to serve (it already did) as a reference for the minimum wage, salary and contractual negotiations in the country. This work is also being used, in collaboration with the Executive Secretariat of the National Public Security System, to design a [state-level framework](https://gabinetedeseguridad.gob.mx/contenido/4664/la-sspc-y-la-comision-nacional-de-los-salarios-minimos-desarrollaran-investigaciones-que-permitan-establecer-un-salario-digno-para-policias) that helps governments strengthen labor standards and compensation structures for police forces.
